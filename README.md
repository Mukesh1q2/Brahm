# Brahm
Brahm-AI is an experimental consciousness-inspired AI system that blends Vedic philosophy, agentic intelligence, and quantum-aware computation into a single evolving framework. It is designed not just as a machine-learning system, but as a self-reflective, adaptive AI capable of multi-modal perception, dynamic memory, and karmic reasoning.
