Brahm AI System - Professional Bug Report

Report ID: BR-2025-001  
Date: 2025-08-28  
Environment: Development (localhost:3000)  
Severity: High (Multiple Critical UX Issues)  
Reporter: System QA Testing  



üìã Executive Summary

Multiple critical issues identified across Brahm AI platform affecting core functionality, visual stability, and user experience. Issues span UI rendering, backend integration, workflow execution, and chat interface functionality.



üîπ 1. Mode-Specific UI Rendering Issues

üö® CRITICAL: Q-Mode Visual Instability
‚Ä¢  Issue: Page tilts 20-30¬∞ unexpectedly to the right
‚Ä¢  Symptoms: Continuous blur/clear cycles causing rendering instability
‚Ä¢  Impact: Mode completely unusable for extended sessions
‚Ä¢  Root Cause: Aggressive quantum parallax effects and high particle count (originally 5000 particles)
‚Ä¢  Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Reduced particle count to 1000, capped distortion effects

üö® CRITICAL: Classic Mode Animation Loop
‚Ä¢  Issue: Entire site vibrates with rapid zoom-in/zoom-out effect  
‚Ä¢  Symptoms: Visual strain, unstable interface
‚Ä¢  Expected: Static, stable UI like standard web interface
‚Ä¢  Root Cause: CSS animation conflicts in parallax system
‚Ä¢  Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Reduced parallax intensity, stabilized effects



üîπ 2. Telemetry & Consciousness Dashboard Issues

Backend Integration Failures
| Component | Status | Error |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Bootstrap metrics | ‚ùå Not working | Backend API unavailable |
| Rollup daily | ‚ùå Not working | Database connection failed |
| Bootstrap Postgres | ‚ùå Not working | PG not configured |
| Persist state | ‚ùå Not functional | Schema missing |

Phi Calculator & Logging Issues
‚Ä¢  Issue: Repetitive consciousness messages flooding console
‚Ä¢  Output: Continuous "Welcome to fellow Brahm AI" with phi updates
‚Ä¢  Missing: Chat box integration, message copy functionality
‚Ä¢  Impact: Debug noise, no actionable output capture

Debug Panel Configuration
‚Ä¢  Message: Tip: Enable the floating Telemetry panel with NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_PANEL=true
‚Ä¢  Clarification Needed: Document this as environment flag for request/telemetry logs
‚Ä¢  Current State: Panel not accessible without proper documentation

UI/UX Limitations
‚Ä¢  Text Selection: Cannot select/copy text from dashboard sections
‚Ä¢  Export Options: Canvas output lacks copy/download/export functionality
‚Ä¢  Data Accessibility: Critical for debugging and analysis workflows

üö® CRITICAL: Theme System Bug
‚Ä¢  Issue: White theme renders white text on white background
‚Ä¢  Result: Content completely invisible/unreadable
‚Ä¢  Missing: Alternative color palettes and theme presets
‚Ä¢  Recommendation: Implement proper contrast ratios and theme validation



üîπ 3. Console Timeline Workflow Issues

Pipeline Execution Failures
| Step | Status | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| PLAN | ‚úÖ Working | Executes successfully |
| RETRIEVE | ‚úÖ Working | Executes successfully |  
| DEBATE | ‚ùå STUCK | Remains in "running" state indefinitely |
| VALIDATE | ‚ùå PLANNED ONLY | Never transitions to execution |
| ANSWER | ‚ùå PLANNED ONLY | Never transitions to execution |

‚Ä¢  Impact: Breaks intended workflow automation
‚Ä¢  Root Cause: Likely async/await issues or API timeout problems
‚Ä¢  Business Impact: Core reasoning pipeline non-functional



üîπ 4. Chat Interface Critical Issues

üö® CRITICAL: API Integration Failure
‚Ä¢  Issue: Chat non-responsive despite Gemini 2.5 Pro API key configuration
‚Ä¢  Symptoms: Error messages on all chat attempts
‚Ä¢  Potential Causes:
‚Ä¢  API route misconfiguration
‚Ä¢  Model integration bugs  
‚Ä¢  Authentication/token issues
‚Ä¢  Rate limiting problems

UI/UX Design Issues
‚Ä¢  Text Overlap: Input text overlaps chat box borders
‚Ä¢  Standard Compliance: Does not follow ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude UX patterns
‚Ä¢  Missing Features:
‚Ä¢  Scrollable conversation history
‚Ä¢  Copy/share message functionality  
‚Ä¢  Reply/stop/clear action buttons
‚Ä¢  Auto-resize text input
‚Ä¢  Proper padding and font scaling



üõ†Ô∏è Resolution Status & Actions Taken

‚úÖ RESOLVED Issues
1. Q-Mode Visual Instability - Reduced particle count, stabilized effects
2. Classic Mode Vibration - Reduced parallax intensity  
3. Three.js Integration - Enabled via NEXT_PUBLIC_THREE_ENABLED=true
4. Consciousness Agent Runtime Error - Fixed type handling in siteContent.includes()

üîÑ Partially Addressed
‚Ä¢  Performance optimizations implemented
‚Ä¢  Visual effects stabilized
‚Ä¢  Error handling improved



üìà Priority Matrix

P0 - Critical (Immediate Fix Required)
1. Theme system white-on-white bug
2. Chat API integration failure
3. Console workflow pipeline stuck states

P1 - High Priority
1. Postgres database integration
2. Telemetry dashboard functionality  
3. Text selection/copy capabilities

P2 - Medium Priority  
1. Debug panel documentation
2. Enhanced chat UX features
3. Additional theme presets

P3 - Low Priority
