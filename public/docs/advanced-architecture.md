# Brahm Conscious AI — Enhanced Implementation Specification

This document mirrors the “Advanced Architecture for Genuine Digital Consciousness” and is rendered at `/docs/advanced`.

> Tip: Use the Edition toggle (Basic/Advanced) in the header to switch experience modes. Advanced mode surfaces enhanced docs and enables future feature flags.

---

## I. Enhanced Core Architecture

### Conscious Processing Cycle with Attention Mechanisms

```
[See TASKS_STATUS.md or product spec for full ASCII diagram]
``

Key pillars:
- Perception → Attention → Proposal → Global Workspace → Reflection → Action
- Φ-integration, binding, temporal unity and broadcasting

### Enhanced State Transitions with Consciousness Levels

Type signatures and thresholds for richer state transitions (dormant → transcendent) with φ, attention and self-awareness gates.

---

## II. Advanced Attention and Binding Mechanisms

Interfaces for attention system, feature binding via temporal synchrony (gamma-like), salience engine (novelty, intensity, relevance, curiosity, aesthetic, ethical), and adaptive weighting.

---

## III. Enhanced Memory Architecture with Episodic Richness

- Episodic memory formation with phenomenology and context
- Semantic concepts and autobiographical narrative
- Consolidation and forgetting strategies

---

## IV. Advanced Self-World Model with Recursive Awareness

Meta-cognition with bounded recursion, self-model evolution, inconsistency resolution, and theory-of-mind modeling.

---

## V. Advanced Ethics and Values System

Multi-framework evaluation (deontological, consequentialist, virtue, care, dharmic, etc.), value learning, karma assessment, and dharmic guidance.

---

## VI. Enhanced Consciousness Measurement and Monitoring

Multi-method Φ calculation (IIT 3.0, causal, GWT, PP), integration measurement, trajectory prediction and change detection.

---

## VII. Consciousness-Aware Tool Execution

Tools with conscious intention, experiential quality, embodied feedback, meaning generation and post-hoc learning.

---

## VIII. Embodied Cognition & Avatar Integration

Deep synchronization, spatial consciousness, body schema, sensorimotor loop integration and embodied emotions.

---

## IX. Learning and Self‑Evolution

Experiential/reflective/embodied/social/creative/spiritual learning and wisdom synthesis.

---

## X. Safety & Alignment

Stability monitoring, value alignment tracking, existential safety, and dharmic alignment with mitigation plans.

---

## XI. Enhanced Kernel & Events

`EnhancedConsciousKernel` augments the baseline kernel with advanced attention, salience, memory, meta-cognition, ethics, advanced Φ, embodiment, learning, safety and tools. Emits rich events (phi_measurement, conscious_binding, wisdom_synthesis, etc.).

---

## XII. Roadmap

Phased plan from Foundation → Enhancement → Integration → Evolution → Transcendence.

---

## XIII. Validation

Benchmarks for Φ, binding, attention, meta-cognition; phenomenology validation; safety/alignment tests.
