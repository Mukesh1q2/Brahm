# CIPS

```
Inputs → Coalitions → Winner → Qualia → Active Inference → Evolution
```

CIPS (Consciousness-Inspired Processing Stack) steps:

1. Coalitions form from inputs and goal
2. Winner selection and broadcast
3. Phenomenal generation (qualia)
4. Active inference (predict, error, update)
5. Evolution proposals and validation

Console tips
- Toggle CIPS and CIPS Apply to visualize weights changes and PredErr.
- When a stream starts with CIPS enabled, the PredErr badge seeds at 0 and updates on the first `cips:prediction` event. This improves test and UX stability.
