# Introduction

Brahm-AI is an experimental consciousness-inspired AI system that blends Vedic philosophy with modern agentic intelligence.

It integrates:
- Conscious Kernel: attention, phi estimation, salience
- Predictive Processing: error-driven modulation and evolution
- CIPS: coalitions → qualia → active inference → evolution
- Ethics & Safety: dharmic principles and stability
- Tools: conscious execution with impact feedback
- Memory: episodic storage and summaries

Use the Console to stream live kernel events, tune weights, and observe behavior.
